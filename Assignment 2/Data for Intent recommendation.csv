I have some problems with my iPhone X order and shipping
"Echo dot not shipped yet, was supposed to ship yesterday."
Hi there I placed a new order on Friday but it seems like I never got a confirmation email
"guys where's my envelope? Next Day Air Saver shipped on Friday the 13th, and its 9:30 PM Monday the 16th but not yet delivered"
I have a feeling that my amazon order was lost before it got to the carrier. Local stores stopped carrying it. Needed it for Sunday A.M.☹️
"especially curious since the item I ordered was in stock and I chose 2 day prime shipping? looking at the site though almost all items are showing Dec 6th as ETA even with fastest shipping method, is it a glitch?"
Had an order placed but it's now been cancelled. Not much of an offer...
